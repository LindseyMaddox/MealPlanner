Meal Planner App 
...AKA one less decision parents have to make

One of the most exhausting things about being a parent is the number of decisions you have to make. After a long day, deciding what to make for dinner is almost as taxing as making the dinner itself!

What if you had an app that stored all of your favorite meals and offered you suggestions for what to make each week?
MealPlanner (will) ensure you don't repeat meals from one week to the next and keeps you from ending up with 5 nights of chicken! You can also set the difficulty level of your recipes to ensure you're not trapped in the kitchen all evening!

In the future, we may have the option to request a new meal for a specific day, ask for a specified number of meals, or suggest meals based on the ingredients at home you want to use up.
