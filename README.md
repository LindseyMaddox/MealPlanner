Meal Planner App 
...AKA one less decision you have to make

One of the most exhausting things about #adulting is the number of decisions you have to make. After a long day, deciding what to make for dinner is almost as taxing as making the dinner itself!

What if you had an app that stored all of your favorite meals and offered you suggestions for what to make each week?

MealPlanner (will) ensure you don't repeat meals from one week to the next and keeps you from ending up with 5 nights of chicken! You can even 'deactivate' recipes you want to temporarily stop eating.

New features coming: Ability to set preferences for meal selection (e.g. tell the app what difficulty level you want to make)
